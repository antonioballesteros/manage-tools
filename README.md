This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Important

Proyect was designed to have api requests to a backend server.
But with next 14 seems sql requests from server can be done using SSR.
It's a nice feature.

In any case, the information is not requested and we use mocketed data.
